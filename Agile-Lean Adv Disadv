As soon as a Mimimum Marketable Feature (MMF) has been completed it can be released to the customer.
This allows the customer to see potential benefits of the product before it is finished.

High focus on short burst-type iterations that spend the whole iteration working on a 
small facet of the entire project is an easy way to lose sight of the 'bigger picture'.
What this can mean is that we can focus too much on what may be a low priority feature/implementation.

As customers are also more integral, their perhaps skewed vision can also negatively
affect iterations' focus on the entire project.
